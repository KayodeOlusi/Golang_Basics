## Goals

- Practice variadic functions
- Practice and review managing types

## Setup

- Feel free to refactor the code from `solution.go`, or create a new file called `solution2.go` in the same directory.

## Directions

1. Refactor your code to use a variadic function that takes in an unknown number of arguments. 

## Hints

_HINT_: To find the length of a collection, use `len(someCollection)`.

_HINT_: Check the type of `len(someCollection)`
